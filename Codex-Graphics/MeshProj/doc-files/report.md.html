Algorithm Specification
===============================================================================

To create the meshes i used hard coding techiniques for creating the tetrahedran,
cube and a 3-face cylinder.

The tetrahedran wwas a fairly straightforward code. The .off file type
takes in 3 numbers at the top

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~C
//vertexcount trianglecount edgecount
8 16 32

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The edgecount although is not as mandatory as the other two. these numbers describe the number of vertex 
inputs and the number of triangle inputs your file is goinf to have.

For the cube I had 8 vertices and 12 triangles - 2 triangle per side.
The order of the vertices determines the position associated with it, using which we mark off three vertex numbers to
form one triangle.

Forexample: 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~C
1 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 1
3 0 1 2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first three lines are the coordinates of the points 0 1 and 2 respectively. the last line
indicates three vertices form a face and we list the vertex position in order.
Always makesure the order of the vertices you are drawing follow one direction clockwise or counter clockwise.
This is essentialy to make sure the triangles get drawn. 
0 1 2 and 2 1 0 will work but 2 0 1 wont.

__TODO:__

Once I had worked out the cube, I had did the cylinder and then wrote the code to create files with .off
extensions. The next step is to make this code automate the creation of a wine glass and also add the _gui_ 
necessary to make the changes live in the development environment.

Once i have solved this, i will move on to the hightfield problem, thich is inhenrently new to me. 
And lastly I will solve the water tight / closede mesh.
