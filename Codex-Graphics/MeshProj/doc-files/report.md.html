Algorithm Specification
===============================================================================

Description
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Create Meshes algorithm is a set of algorithms that create a cube, cylinder, wineglass and terrain meshes.

The Strategy pattern was used to setup the solution. This pattern allowed the flexibility of creating any mesh I needed at runtime.
They also share some core functions that can be overlapped or reused, like setting up the vertices and triangles of the mesh.
The task of this algorithm is to setup the vertex positons and the triangle connections which are saved out in .off files, which the G3D engine inturn reads to produce the mesh. For this task the main abstract class `Mesh` is setup with the necessary overlapping properties, some virtual and pure virtual functions. ALthough the implementation of these functions is fundamentally different for the `Terrain` and `Cylinder`, they both are similar in the steps and the general layout of the `.off` file. For this reason, it made better sense to use the Strategy pattern to define the overlaps in a parent interface/class and subsequestly only write the necessary functions the differ.

PSEUDOCODE
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
`Mesh` *abstract class*<br>
The class sets the common variables and the overridden methods needed by the other implementing concrete classes.
By setting up the mesh class it makes it easier to call extend the class as needed for other mesh object implementations
and also provides the oppurtunity to call them interchangeably at runtime.

`writeDimensions()`
	this function calculates the triangle and vertex counts of the mesh
`writeVertices()`
	this function auto generates the vertex locations based on the row and column count
`writeTriangles()`
	this function auto generates the three vertices that make each triangle of the mesh.

The bulk of the **Cylinder** and **Terrain** class has the implementation of the overriden methods.
The **Terrain** class also implements the `calculateHeight()` function. This funciton reads the incoming image file and saves out
the greyscale values as height fields of the corresponding pixel. This informaiton in read in at the time the vertices are
saved out to file and used. Similar to this function, the **WineGlass** class also has a `calculateRadius()` function
that has a similar purpose but writes out the radius and height informtion.

TIME ANALYSIS
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The is a $\O(n)$ time algorithm as for every mesh the function is run only once.
Within each algorithm the reading and writting time of the height field depends on the
resolution of the `xz`-axis and the number of rows and colums. This makes the terrain
$\O(n^2)$
