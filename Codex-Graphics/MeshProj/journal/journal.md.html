2020-09-20: New Section
=============================================================
![fixed angle of terrain](2020-09-20__003_fixed_angle_of_terrain.jpg)

the y direction is always zero.now new issue,triangles are in the wrong side


![terrain flat its the wrong angle](2020-09-20__002_terrain_flat_its_the_wrong_angle.jpg)


![fixed precision](2020-09-20__001_fixed_precision.jpg)

i fixed the mismatched triangle sizes by getting rid of the two point precision
and changing the angle to be divided by number of cols to 2Pi instead of 360.
Keeping the value in radians helps. 



![precision](2020-09-20__000_precision.jpg)

The precision of the vertex position is set to two and this is causeing
mismatches in the triangle size. 


2020-09-19: New Section
