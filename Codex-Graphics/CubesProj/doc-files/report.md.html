                            **Cube Project Report**


System Overview
===============================================================================

The starter documentation for this program is App.cpp[..\build\doc\index.html]
is the where th program runs from. All scene files have the extension __.Any__


Order of projects start from:
1. whiteCube.Scene.Any
2. MyCornell.Scene.Any
3. stairs.Scene.Any

G3D VERSION
==============================================================================
I used G3D to create _whiteCube_ and _MyCornell_, both of which are pretty starightforward. For the stairs Scene on th
otherhand, the starir are generated using a funtion in the main App.cpp file. This function is called makeStairs.
It populates the stairs in a loop and automatically adds it to the scene.

UNITY VERSION
================================================================================
I executed this project in unity as well and got pefecty good results in less time. Unity is my favored
version of a good 3d game development and graphics software.

![Custom Scene inspired by legos.](complexTransform.jpg width="500px")

The custom scene was not an easy task, I needed somehting complex enough to challenege me and
also look visually appealing. The last was as important as the first. So I browsed through different ideas
and reaing through the project specification helped a lot. in the introduction it talks about legos being scaled cube.
So, my project clicked. i went through the lego basics page and found something I really liked that had a good visual.

There were two piece os legos that have a slanted look to them. These were also created by using one cube scaled and rotated to
sit at an angle to the first so as to make it look slanted.

Reflection
=================================================================================
The primary learning in this project was transforming cubes. Albeit my periferal leraning
centered around learning from my mistakes, getting blocked at code generation, not being able to learn
or adapt to a strange environment with very little help. I put the assignment on pause for over 3 months.
I successfully created the Cornell box, but the stairs stumped me. I could just as easily create them in unity, 
even with spendid results, but the solution seemed far too impossible in G3D. 
But coming back to the problem and staying on task until i finished it gave me a boost like no other. I finally accomplished all that I intended.
